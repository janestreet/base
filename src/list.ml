(* There are a few optimized list operations here, including append and map.  There are
   basically two optimizations in play: loop unrolling, and dynamic switching between
   stack and heap allocation.

   The loop-unrolling is straightforward, we just unroll 5 levels of the loop.  This makes
   each iteration faster, and also reduces the number of stack frames consumed per list
   element.

   The dynamic switching is done by counting the number of stack frames, and then
   switching to the "slow" implementation when we exceed a given limit.  This means that
   short lists use the fast stack-allocation method, and long lists use a slower one that
   doesn't require stack space. *)

     input list and repeating.

     With this strategy, in the accumulator:
     - we only ever have elements of sizes a power of two
     - we never have more than one element of each size
     - the sum of all the element sizes is equal to the number of elements consumed

     These conditions enforce that list of elements of each size is precisely the binary
     expansion of the number of elements consumed: if you've consumed 13 = 0b1101
     elements, you have one element of size 8, one of size 4, and one of size 1.  Hence
     when a new element comes along, the number of combinings you need to do is the number
     of trailing 1s in the binary expansion of [num], the number of elements that have
     already gone into the accumulator.  The accumulator is in ascending order of size, so

     However, in most use cases [f] is likely to be expensive (otherwise why do you care
     about the order of reduction?) so the overhead of this function itself doesn't really
     matter. If you come up with a use-case where it does, then that's something you might
     want to try: see hg log -pr 49ef065f429d. *)
