(** Floating-point representation and utilities.

    If using 32-bit OCaml, you cannot quite assume operations act as you'd expect for IEEE
    64-bit floats.  E.g., one can have [let x = ~-. (2. ** 62.) in x = x -. 1.] evaluate
    to [false] while [let x = ~-. (2. ** 62.) in let y = x -. 1 in x = y] evaluates to
    [true].  This is related to 80-bit registers being used for calculations; you can
    force representation as a 64-bit value by let-binding. *)

(** [round_significant x ~significant_digits:n] rounds to the nearest number with [n]
    significant digits.  More precisely: it returns the representable float closest to [x
    rounded to n significant digits].  It is meant to be equivalent to [sprintf "%.*g" n x
    |> Float.of_string] but faster (10x-15x).  Exact ties are resolved as round-to-even.

    However, it might in rare cases break the contract above.


    It might in some cases appear as if it violates the round-to-even rule:

    {[
      let x = 4.36083208835;;
      let z = 4.3608320883;;
      assert (z = fast_approx_round_significant x ~sf:11)
    ]}

    But in this case so does sprintf, since [x] as a float is slightly
    under-represented:

    {[
      sprintf "%.11g" x = "4.3608320883";;
      sprintf "%.30g" x = "4.36083208834999958014577714493"
    ]}

    More importantly, [round_significant] might sometimes give a different
    result than [sprintf ... |> Float.of_string] because it round-trips through an
    integer.  For example, the decimal fraction 0.009375 is slightly under-represented as
    a float:

    {[ sprintf "%.17g" 0.009375 = "0.0093749999999999997" ]}

    But:

    {[ 0.009375 *. 1e5 = 937.5 ]}

    Therefore:

    {[ round_significant 0.009375 ~significant_digits:3 = 0.00938 ]}

    whereas:

    {[ sprintf "%.3g" 0.009375 = "0.00937" ]}


    In general we believe (and have tested on numerous examples) that the following
    holds for all x:

    {[
      let s = sprintf "%.*g" significant_digits x |> Float.of_string in
      s = round_significant ~significant_digits x
      || s = round_significant ~significant_digits (one_ulp `Up x)
      || s = round_significant ~significant_digits (one_ulp `Down x)
    ]}

    Also, for float representations of decimal fractions (like 0.009375),
    [round_significant] is more likely to give the "desired" result than [sprintf ... |>
    of_string] (that is, the result of rounding the decimal fraction, rather than its
    float representation).  But it's not guaranteed either--see the [4.36083208835]
    example above.

(** [round_decimal x ~decimal_digits:n] rounds [x] to the nearest [10**(-n)]. For positive

    faster.

    All the considerations mentioned in [round_significant] apply (both functions use the
    same code path).

(** [to_string x] builds a string [s] representing the float [x] that guarantees the round

    [3.14] as [3.1400000000000001243].  The only exception is that occasionally it will

(** Produce a lossy compact string representation of the float.  The float is scaled by
    an appropriate power of 1000 and rendered with one digit after the decimal point,
    except that the decimal point is written as '.', 'k', 'm', 'g', 't', or 'p' to
    indicate the scale factor.  (However, if the digit after the "decimal" point is 0,
    it is suppressed.)

    The smallest scale factor that allows the number to be rendered with at most 3 digits
    to the left of the decimal is used.  If the number is too large for this format (i.e.,
    the absolute value is at least 999.95e15), scientific notation is used instead. E.g.:

    - [to_padded_compact_string     (-0.01) =  "-0  "]
    - [to_padded_compact_string       1.89  =   "1.9"]
    - [to_padded_compact_string 999_949.99  = "999k9"]
    - [to_padded_compact_string 999_950.    =   "1m "]

    In the case where the digit after the "decimal", or the "decimal" itself is omitted,
    the numbers are padded on the right with spaces to ensure the last two columns of the
    string always correspond to the decimal and the digit afterward (except in the case of
    scientific notation, where the exponent is the right-most element in the string and
    could take up to four characters).

    - [to_padded_compact_string    1. =    "1  "]
    - [to_padded_compact_string  1.e6 =    "1m "]
    - [to_padded_compact_string 1.e16 = "1.e+16"]
    - [to_padded_compact_string max_finite_value = "1.8e+308"]

    Numbers in the range -.05 < x < .05 are rendered as "0  " or "-0  ".

    Other cases:

    - [to_padded_compact_string nan          =  "nan  "]
    - [to_padded_compact_string infinity     =  "inf  "]
    - [to_padded_compact_string neg_infinity = "-inf  "]

    Exact ties are resolved to even in the decimal:

    - [to_padded_compact_string      3.25 =  "3.2"]
    - [to_padded_compact_string      3.75 =  "3.8"]
    - [to_padded_compact_string 33_250.   = "33k2"]
    - [to_padded_compact_string 33_350.   = "33k4"] *)
val to_padded_compact_string : t -> string

(** [int_pow x n] computes [x ** float n] via repeated squaring.  It is generally much
    faster than [**].

    Note that [int_pow x 0] always returns [1.], even if [x = nan].  This
    coincides with [x ** 0.] and is intentional.

    For [n >= 0] the result is identical to an n-fold product of [x] with itself under
    [*.], with a certain placement of parentheses.  For [n < 0] the result is identical
    to [int_pow (1. /. x) (-n)].

    The error will be on the order of [|n|] ulps, essentially the same as if you
    perturbed [x] by up to a ulp and then exponentiated exactly.

    Benchmarks show a factor of 5-10 speedup (relative to [**]) for exponents up to about
    1000 (approximately 10ns vs. 70ns).  For larger exponents the advantage is smaller but
    persists into the trillions.  For a recent or more detailed comparison, run the
    benchmarks.

    Depending on context, calling this function might or might not allocate 2 minor words.
    Even if called in a way that causes allocation, it still appears to be faster than
