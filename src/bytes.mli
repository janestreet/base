(** OCaml's byte sequence type, semantically similar to a [char array], but
    taking less space in memory.

    A byte sequence is a mutable data structure that contains a fixed-length
    sequence of bytes (of type [char]). Each byte can be indexed in constant
    time for reading or writing. *)

(** {2:unsafe Unsafe conversions (for advanced users)}

    This section describes unsafe, low-level conversion functions between
    [bytes] and [string]. They might not copy the internal data; used
    improperly, they can break the immutability invariant on strings provided
    by the [-safe-string] option. They are available for expert library
    authors, but for most purposes you should use the always-correct
    {!Bytes.to_string} and {!Bytes.of_string} instead.
*)

(** Unsafely convert a byte sequence into a string.

    To reason about the use of [unsafe_to_string], it is convenient to
    consider an "ownership" discipline. A piece of code that
    manipulates some data "owns" it; there are several disjoint ownership
    modes, including:
    {ul
    {- Unique ownership: the data may be accessed and mutated}
    {- Shared ownership: the data has several owners, that may only
    access it, not mutate it.}}
    Unique ownership is linear: passing the data to another piece of
    code means giving up ownership (we cannot access the
    data again). A unique owner may decide to make the data shared
    (giving up mutation rights on it), but shared data may not become
    uniquely-owned again.
    [unsafe_to_string s] can only be used when the caller owns the byte
    sequence [s] -- either uniquely or as shared immutable data. The
    caller gives up ownership of [s], and gains (the same mode of) ownership
    of the returned string.
    There are two valid use-cases that respect this ownership
    discipline:
    {ol
    {- The first is creating a string by initializing and mutating a byte
    sequence that is never changed after initialization is performed.
    {[
      let string_init len f : string =
        let s = Bytes.create len in
        for i = 0 to len - 1 do Bytes.set s i (f i) done;
        Bytes.unsafe_to_string ~no_mutation_while_string_reachable:s
    ]}
    This function is safe because the byte sequence [s] will never be
    accessed or mutated after [unsafe_to_string] is called. The
    [string_init] code gives up ownership of [s], and returns the
    ownership of the resulting string to its caller.

    Note that it would be unsafe if [s] was passed as an additional
    parameter to the function [f] as it could escape this way and be
    mutated in the future -- [string_init] would give up ownership of
    [s] to pass it to [f], and could not call [unsafe_to_string]
    safely.

    We have provided the {!String.init}, {!String.map} and
    {!String.mapi} functions to cover most cases of building
    new strings. You should prefer those over [to_string] or
    [unsafe_to_string] whenever applicable.}
    {- The second is temporarily giving ownership of a byte sequence to
    a function that expects a uniquely owned string and returns ownership
    back, so that we can mutate the sequence again after the call ended.
    {[
      let bytes_length (s : bytes) =
        String.length
          (Bytes.unsafe_to_string ~no_mutation_while_string_reachable:s)
    ]}
    In this use-case, we do not promise that [s] will never be mutated
    after the call to [bytes_length s]. The {!String.length} function
    temporarily borrows unique ownership of the byte sequence
    (and sees it as a [string]), but returns this ownership back to
    the caller, which may assume that [s] is still a valid byte
    sequence after the call. Note that this is only correct because we
    know that {!String.length} does not capture its argument -- it could
    escape by a side-channel such as a memoization combinator.
    The caller may not mutate [s] while the string is borrowed (it has
    temporarily given up ownership). This affects concurrent programs,
    but also higher-order functions: if {!String.length} returned
    a closure to be called later, [s] should not be mutated until this
    closure is fully applied and returns ownership.}}
*)
val unsafe_to_string : no_mutation_while_string_reachable:t -> string

(** Unsafely convert a shared string to a byte sequence that should
    not be mutated.

    The same ownership discipline that makes [unsafe_to_string]
    correct applies to [unsafe_of_string_promise_no_mutation],
    however unique ownership of string values is extremely difficult
    to reason about correctly in practice. As such, one should always
    assume strings are shared, never uniquely owned (For example,
    string literals are implicitly shared by the compiler, so you
    never uniquely own them)

    The only case we have reasonable confidence is safe is if the
    produced [bytes] is shared -- used as an immutable byte
    sequence. This is possibly useful for incremental migration of
    low-level programs that manipulate immutable sequences of bytes
    (for example {!Marshal.from_bytes}) and previously used the
    [string] type for this purpose.
