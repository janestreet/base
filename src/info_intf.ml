(** [Info] is a library for lazily constructing human-readable information as a string
    or sexp, with a primary use being error messages.

    Using [Info] is often preferable to [sprintf] or manually constructing strings
    because you don't have to eagerly construct the string -- you only need to pay when
    you actually want to display the info, which for many applications is rare.  Using
    [Info] is also better than creating custom exceptions because you have more control
    over the format.

    Info is intended to be constructed in the following style; for simple info, you
    write:

    {[Info.of_string "Unable to find file"]}

    Or for a more descriptive [Info] without attaching any content (but evaluating the
    result eagerly):

    {[Info.createf "Process %s exited with code %d" process exit_code]}

    For info where you want to attach some content, you would write:

    {[Info.create "Unable to find file" filename [%sexp_of: string]]}

    Or even,

    {[
      Info.create "price too big" (price, [`Max max_price])
        [%sexp_of: float * [`Max of float]]
    ]}

    Note that an [Info.t] can be created from any arbitrary sexp with [Info.t_of_sexp].

      the string is only one line long.  To do this, use [to_string_mach t]. *)
