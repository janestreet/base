(** A low-level, mutable AVL tree.

    It is not intended to be used directly by casual users. It is used for implementing
    other data structures. The interface is somewhat ugly, and it's that way for a reason:
    the goal of this module is minimum memory overhead and maximum performance.

    {2 Caveats}

    1. [compare] is passed to every function where it is used. If you pass a different
       [compare] to functions on the same tree, then behavior is indeterminate. Why?
       Because otherwise we'd need a top-level record to store [compare], and when
       building a hash table, or other structure, that little [t] is a block that
       increases memory overhead. However, if an empty tree is just a constructor [Empty],
       then it's just a number, and uses no extra memory beyond the array bucket that
       holds it. That's the first secret of how Hashtbl's memory overhead isn't higher
       than INRIA's, even though it uses a tree instead of a list for buckets.

    2. But if it's mutable, why do all the "mutators" return [t]? Answer: it is mutable,
       but the root node might change due to balancing. Since we have no top-level record
       to hold the current root node (see point 1), you have to do it. If you fail to do
       it, and use an old root node, you're responsible for the (sure to be nasty)
       consequences.

    3. What on earth is up with the [~removed] argument to some functions? See point 1:
       since there is no top-level node, it isn't possible to keep track of how many nodes
       are in the tree unless each mutator tells you whether or not it added or removed a
       node (vs. replacing an existing one). If you intend to keep a count (as you must in
       a hash table), then you will need to pay attention to this flag.

    After all this, you're probably asking yourself whether all these hacks are worth it.
    Yes! They are! With them, we built a hash table that is faster than INRIA's (no small
    feat) with the same memory overhead, sane add semantics (the add semantics they used
    were a performance hack), and worst-case log(N) insertion, lookup, and removal. *)
