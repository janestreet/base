(* [Char0] defines char functions that are primitives or can be simply defined in terms of
   [Caml.Char].  [Char0] is intended to completely express the part of [Caml.Char] that
   [Base] uses -- no other file in Base other than char0.ml should use [Caml.Char].
   [Char0] has few dependencies, and so is available early in Base's build order.  All
   Base files that need to use chars and come before [Base.Char] in build order should do
   [module Char = Char0].  Defining [module Char = Char0] is also necessary because it
   prevents ocamldep from mistakenly causing a file to depend on [Base.Char]. *)
