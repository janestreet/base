    Its value is one of:
    - ["Unix"] (for all Unix versions, including Linux and macOS);
    - ["Win32"] (for MS-Windows, OCaml compiled with MSVC++ or MinGW); or
    - ["Cygwin"] (for MS-Windows, OCaml compiled with Cygwin)

(** Returns the name of the runtime variant the program is running on. This is normally
    the argument given to [-runtime-variant] at compile time, but for byte-code it can be
    changed after compilation.

    When running in JavaScript or utop it will be [""], while if compiled with DEBUG
    (debugging of the runtime) it will be ["d"], and if compiled with CAML_INSTR
    (instrumentation of the runtime) it will be ["i"]. *)

    [[.patchlevel]] and [[+additional-info]] parts may be absent. *)

(** Controls whether the OCaml runtime system can emit warnings on stderr. Currently, the
    only supported warning is triggered when a channel created by [open_*] functions is
    finalized without being closed. Runtime warnings are enabled by default. *)
val enable_runtime_warnings : bool -> unit

(** Returns whether runtime warnings are currently enabled. *)
val runtime_warnings_enabled : unit -> bool

(** Return the value associated to a variable in the process environment. Return [None] if

(** For the purposes of optimization, [opaque_identity] behaves like an unknown (and thus
    possibly side-effecting) function. At runtime, [opaque_identity] disappears
    altogether. A typical use of this function is to prevent pure computations from being
    optimized away in benchmarking loops. For example:

    {[
      for _round = 1 to 100_000 do
        ignore (Sys.opaque_identity (my_pure_computation ()))
      done
